We are reaching the end.
So, I will tell something, this is not the end yet because we still have a lot to do.
Or maybe you can do say "this is the end".
But is just going to be the end of this chapter.
Sometimes we do have to finish, say goodbye to things just to be able to start writting a new story.
So here is me saying goodbye to you.
Goodbye.
