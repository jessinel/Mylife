But I do know how is it going and is not going very well. 
But here we are, trying to make things work out for us.
Meanwhile, the time goes so fast and so slow at the same time or that is how I feel.
I can heard them playing outside while I am here in my world, pushing to improve myself and have a better life.
Don't know how I ended up here wrintting but this is what I got right now.
The other day I used the word "hopeless" because that's what my heart was screaming even if I never lost faith, never. 
If is there one thing I have is called FAITH ! 
Even on the worse times I always believed that everything happens for a reason and hoping for a good reason.
